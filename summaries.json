  "doc-1754095436961-llr9zyu08": "Your child Ethan had a regular check-up to monitor his development. He has Autism Spectrum Disorder, finds it difficult to process sensory information, and is delayed in his speech. \n\nDuring the visit, the doctor noticed that Ethan doesn't make much eye contact, but he was calm. His speech is limited to single words and certain set phrases. He gets frustrated if his routine is disrupted, like if a toy is taken away. He played by himself with toys and didn't try to interact with the doctor. When there was too much noise, he flapped his hands a bit.\n\nEthan has slightly improved in his ability to use words spontaneously, but still mostly uses gestures to communicate. He doesn't engage much with his peers, but does better in structured group settings. His behavior has improved, with fewer meltdowns at home, but noise and changes in routine can still upset him. His physical skills are as expected.\n\nYou've expressed concern about Ethan's delayed speech, his difficulty with transitions at school drop-off, and you're interested in exploring AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) options.\n\nThe doctor recommends continuing speech therapy twice a week, focusing on practical communication and trying out AAC. She also suggests keeping the weekly occupational therapy sessions to help with sensory integration and emotional regulation. She recommends updating Ethan's Individualized Education Program (IEP) at school to include support for transitions and sensory breaks. She also thinks Ethan should have a hearing test, since it's been over a year since his last one. Lastly, she suggests you join a group for parents to learn communication strategies.\n\nEthan is not on any medication at the moment. The doctor would like to see Ethan again in 6 months, and wants to schedule an AAC evaluation in the next 4-6 weeks. She also wants Ethan to have his hearing tested by the end of August 2025.",
